Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and SeasonalFlu Vaccines 

Beginning in spring 2009, a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, colloquially named "swine flu," swept across the world. Researchers estimate that in the first year, it was responsible for between 151,000 to 575,000 deaths globally. The given dataset contains 36 features that are relevant to the social, economic, demographic background of the members  opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviors towards mitigating transmission which are collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. Guessing patterns or analysing patterns through a large data set manually is not actually hard. It is impossible. So this project is focused on predicting probabilities, whether the member with the given dataset has gotten H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines or not.
